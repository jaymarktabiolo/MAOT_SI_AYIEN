# Interactive Flower Bouquet Thank You Proposal

## Overview

This is a romantic, interactive web application designed as a "Thank You Proposal" featuring animated flower bouquets. The application provides an elegant, starry-night themed interface where users can select different types of flower bouquets to express gratitude. The project combines visual animations, background music, and interactive elements to create an immersive romantic experience.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No frameworks used, keeping it lightweight and simple
- **Static Web Application**: Served via Python's built-in HTTP server
- **Client-Side Only**: All logic runs in the browser with no backend processing
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with CSS animations

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with audio element support
- **CSS3**: Advanced animations, gradients, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ classes and modern DOM manipulation
- **External Libraries**: Font Awesome icons and Google Fonts
- **Audio**: MP3 background music integration

## Key Components

### 1. Visual Interface (`index.html`)

4. **Audio Control**: Background music plays/pauses based on user preference
5. **State Management**: Current bouquet selection and music state tracked in JavaScript
